<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Proximity Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared proximity sensors are classified into two main types: active and passive. Active sensors emit infrared light and then detect the reflected signal to determine the proximity of an object. Passive sensors, on the other hand, do not emit any light but instead detect the infrared radiation emitted by objects in their vicinity. Active sensors are commonly used for distance measurement and object detection, while passive sensors are more suitable for applications where energy efficiency is a priority.</p></p>
