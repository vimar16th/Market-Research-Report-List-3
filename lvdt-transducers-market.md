<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LVDT Transducers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Type</li><li>DC Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LVDT transducers are commonly categorized into two main types - AC type and DC type transducers. AC type transducers generate a sine wave output that is linearly proportional to the displacement of the core within the coil assembly. DC type transducers, on the other hand, produce a DC voltage output that changes linearly with core movement. AC type transducers are preferred for dynamic measurements, while DC type transducers are suitable for static measurements due to their ability to maintain position even in the absence of power.</p></p>
