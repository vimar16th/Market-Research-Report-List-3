<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ribbed Steel Bars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-rolling</li><li>Cold rolling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ribbed steel bars are commonly used in construction due to their high tensile strength and durability. The hot-rolling market involves the process of shaping the steel bars at high temperatures, resulting in a stronger and more ductile product. On the other hand, the cold rolling market involves shaping the steel bars at lower temperatures, which can produce a smoother surface finish but may sacrifice some of the material's strength. Both markets cater to different preferences based on the specific requirements of construction projects.</p></p>
