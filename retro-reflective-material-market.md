<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retro-Reflective Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microprismatic</li><li>Glass Beads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retro-reflective materials are used to enhance the visibility of objects in low light conditions by reflecting light back to its source. There are two main types of retro-reflective materials: microprismatic and glass beads. Microprismatic materials have a structured surface that reflects light back in a concentrated beam, making them ideal for high-visibility applications. Glass beads, on the other hand, are spherical and disperse light in all directions, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. Both types play a crucial role in increasing safety and visibility in various industries.</p></p>
