<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DC-DC Converter for EV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isolated</li><li>Non-Isolated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DC-DC converters for EVs come in two main types: isolated and non-isolated. Isolated converters provide electrical isolation between input and output, making them safer and more reliable for high-voltage applications. They are commonly used in electric vehicles to prevent potential hazards. On the other hand, non-isolated converters do not have this isolation, making them more cost-effective and efficient for low-voltage applications. Both types play a crucial role in converting and regulating the voltage for various components in electric vehicles.</p></p>
