<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interference Optical Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Pass Type</li><li>Low-Pass Type</li><li>Band-Pass Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Interference optical filters come in three main types - High-Pass, Low-Pass, and Band-Pass. High-Pass filters allow high-frequency light to pass through while blocking low-frequency light. Low-Pass filters do the opposite, allowing low-frequency light to pass through while blocking high-frequency light. Band-Pass filters only allow a specific range of frequencies to pass through while blocking others. Each type of filter is designed to suit different applications and provide precise control over the wavelengths of light that are transmitted or blocked.</p></p>
