<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Traction Converter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Propulsion Converter</li><li>Integrated Compact Converter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Traction converters can be broadly classified into two types: propulsion converters and integrated compact converters. Propulsion converters are specifically designed to convert electrical energy for the propulsion of vehicles, such as trains or electric cars. On the other hand, integrated compact converters are more versatile and can be used in various applications where space is limited. These converters are usually smaller in size and can be integrated into different systems for efficient energy conversion. Both types play a crucial role in the efficient operation of electric vehicles and trains.</p></p>
