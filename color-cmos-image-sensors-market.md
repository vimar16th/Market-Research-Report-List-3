<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Color CMOS Image Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Global Shutter</li><li>Rolling Shutter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Color CMOS Image Sensors are available in two types - Global Shutter and Rolling Shutter. Global Shutter sensors capture the entire image at once, which eliminates distortion in fast-moving objects. This makes them ideal for applications requiring precise timing and accurate representation of moving objects. In contrast, Rolling Shutter sensors capture the image line by line, resulting in distortion when capturing fast-moving objects. They are suitable for applications where cost is a concern and slight distortion is acceptable. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications based on the requirements.</p></p>
