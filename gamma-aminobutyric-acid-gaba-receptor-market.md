<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Receptor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>GABA-A Receptor</li><li>GABA-B Receptor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Receptors are neurotransmitter receptors that play a crucial role in regulating brain activity. There are two main types of GABA receptors - GABA-A and GABA-B receptors. GABA-A receptors are ionotropic receptors that primarily mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission, while GABA-B receptors are metabotropic receptors that modulate neurotransmitter release and regulate synaptic transmission. Both types of GABA receptors are important pharmacological targets for the treatment of various neurological disorders such as anxiety, epilepsy, and insomnia.</p></p>
