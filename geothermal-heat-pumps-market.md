<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Heat Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Closed Loop</li><li>Horizontal Closed Loop</li><li>Open Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal heat pumps are categorized into three main types - vertical closed loop, horizontal closed loop, and open loop markets. The vertical closed loop utilizes vertical boreholes drilled into the ground to circulate a fluid that absorbs or releases heat. The horizontal closed loop consists of pipes buried horizontally in the ground to achieve the same heat exchange. On the other hand, open loop systems use groundwater from a well as the heat source or sink. These different market types offer varying advantages and suitability depending on factors such as available land area and local water supply.</p></p>
