<p><h1>Activated Carbon Injection Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Material, By Type, By End-user, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Activated Carbon Injection Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Activated Carbon Injection (ACI) is a technology used to control mercury emissions from industries by injecting powdered activated carbon into the flue gas stream. The activated carbon adsorbs mercury from the gas, capturing it before it can be released into the atmosphere. This technology is widely used in coal-fired power plants, cement plants, waste incinerators, and other industrial facilities to comply with environmental regulations.</p><p>The Activated Carbon Injection Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.4% during the forecast period. The increasing focus on environmental regulations and the need for emission control technologies in industries are driving the growth of the ACI market. Additionally, the rising awareness about the harmful effects of mercury emissions on human health and the environment is also fueling the demand for activated carbon injection systems.</p><p>The latest trends in the Activated Carbon Injection Market include the development of advanced ACI systems with higher efficiency and lower operational costs. Manufacturers are also focusing on innovations in activated carbon products to improve mercury capture rates and reduce overall emissions. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of ACI technology in emerging markets and the expansion of coal-fired power plants are expected to create lucrative opportunities for market growth in the coming years.</p></p>
