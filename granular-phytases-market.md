<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Granular Phytases Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acid Phytase</li><li>Alkaline Phytase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Granular phytases are enzymes that help in breaking down phytic acid in plant-based foods, releasing phosphorus and other nutrients for better absorption. There are two main types of granular phytases- acid phytase and alkaline phytase. Acid phytase works in acidic environments, like the stomach, while alkaline phytase works in alkaline environments, like the intestines. Both types of phytases play a crucial role in improving nutrient availability in animal feed and promoting better digestion and growth in livestock.</p></p>
