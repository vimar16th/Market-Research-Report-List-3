<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart 3D Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Binocular Stereo Vision</li><li>Time of Flight</li><li>Structured Light</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart 3D cameras are classified into three main market types: binocular stereo vision, time of flight, and structured light. Binocular stereo vision uses two cameras to capture images and create a 3D representation. Time of flight cameras measure the time it takes for light to travel to an object and back to determine depth. Structured light cameras project a pattern of light onto an object and use the distortion of the pattern to calculate depth. Each market type has its own strengths and applications in various industries.</p></p>
