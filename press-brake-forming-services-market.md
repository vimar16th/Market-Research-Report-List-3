<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Press Brake Forming Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Bending</li><li>Bottom Bending</li><li>Coining</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Press brake forming services refer to the process of bending and shaping metal sheets using a press brake machine. The market types in this industry include air bending, bottom bending, and coining. Air bending involves using the force of the upper tool to shape the metal sheet into a desired angle without touching the lower tool. Bottom bending involves using the lower tool as a fulcrum to bend the metal sheet. Coining, on the other hand, involves compressing the metal sheet between the upper and lower tools to create precise shapes with high accuracy.</p></p>
