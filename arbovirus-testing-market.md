<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arbovirus Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Antibody Tests</li><li>Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arbovirus testing includes two main market types: antibody tests and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Antibody tests detect the presence of specific antibodies produced by the immune system in response to arbovirus infection. These tests are used to identify past or current infections in individuals. On the other hand, NAAT directly detects the arbovirus genetic material (RNA or DNA) in a patient's sample. NAAT is more commonly used in early stages of infection when the viral load is high, providing faster and more accurate results.</p></p>
