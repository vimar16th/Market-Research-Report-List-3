<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Radiators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Down-Flow</li><li>Cross-Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive radiators are classified into two main types based on the direction of coolant flow - Down-Flow and Cross-Flow radiators. Down-Flow radiators have the tanks located at the top and bottom of the core, causing the coolant to flow vertically through the core. On the other hand, Cross-Flow radiators have tanks located on the sides of the core, leading to a horizontal flow of coolant. Each type has its own advantages and is chosen based on specific vehicle requirements and design considerations.</p></p>
