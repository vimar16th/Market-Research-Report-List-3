<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refractory Bricks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unshaped (Monolithic Refractories)</li><li>Shaped</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refractory bricks market can be classified into two main types: unshaped (monolithic refractories) and shaped. Unshaped refractories consist of a mixture of aggregates, binders, and additives that are poured or applied in place to form a lining. Shaped refractories, on the other hand, are preformed products such as bricks, tiles, and blocks that are used to build linings in high-temperature applications. Both types of refractories play a crucial role in industries such as steel, cement, and glass manufacturing.</p></p>
