<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Processing Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Catalyst</li><li>Deactivation Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chemical processing catalyst market can be divided into two main types: active catalyst and deactivation catalyst. Active catalysts are those that actively participate in the reaction process by providing a surface for reactants to bind and undergo chemical transformation. On the other hand, deactivation catalysts are catalysts that become less effective over time due to factors such as poisoning, fouling, or thermal deactivation. Both types play crucial roles in the catalytic process and are important for efficient and sustainable chemical processing operations.</p></p>
