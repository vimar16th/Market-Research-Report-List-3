<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wave Solder Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corrosive</li><li>Non-Corrosive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wave solder flux is classified into two main types based on their chemical composition and effects on the PCB assembly process: corrosive and non-corrosive flux. </p><p>Corrosive flux contains active ingredients that can cause oxidation and corrosion on the solder joints if not properly cleaned after soldering. It is more aggressive in removing oxides and contaminants from the metal surfaces.</p><p>Non-corrosive flux, on the other hand, is designed to be milder and less reactive, reducing the risk of long-term damage to the components. It is typically used for sensitive electronic components that cannot withstand harsh cleaning processes.</p></p>
