<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shielded Type TBMs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Shielded</li><li>Double Shielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shielded Type TBMs, or Tunnel Boring Machines, can be classified into two main market types: Single Shielded and Double Shielded. </p><p>A Single Shielded TBM consists of a single shield or cutter head to excavate the tunnel face while ground support is simultaneously installed. This TBM type is suitable for stable and relatively soft ground conditions.</p><p>On the other hand, a Double Shielded TBM features a main shield at the tunnel face and a smaller rear shield to provide additional ground support during excavation. These TBMs are used in more challenging ground conditions, such as unstable or mixed soil and rock formations.</p><p>Both Single Shielded and Double Shielded TBMs are valuable tools for efficiently and safely constructing tunnels in various geotechnical conditions, with the choice depending on the specific characteristics of the project.</p></p>
